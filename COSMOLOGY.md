# Purity golf: why this project exists

UCG-50 is the local test bed for separating a golf experience into a course-only
display and a phone cockpit, before carrying the pattern into Odysseus/Unreal.
The phone carries decisions; the screen carries the place. The original
`UCG50_R06_Play.html` is retained as evidence and an executable baseline.

## Decisions and their reasons

**Vanilla TypeScript and Vite.** This follows the owner's GoSavis and portfolio
pattern: explicit application surfaces, shared core, native DOM and CSS. New
code uses strict TypeScript because messages and physics refactors cross module
boundaries. Existing JavaScript remains allowed so extraction does not require a
simultaneous language rewrite. `checkJs` is off; those files are not fully typed.

**One display owns simulation.** The phone sends intent, not authoritative shot
results. A relay delivers messages without calculating physics. This avoids two
independent engines drifting and keeps the complete shot calculation local to the
display browser. The shared engine is reusable without the lab's DOM controls.

**Local WebSocket relay.** One Node process serves the built app and joins one
display to one phone. There is no signalling service, cloud session database,
account system, multi-room platform, or server-side physics. GitHub is source
history and synchronisation, not game networking or hosting. Tests also run locally.

**Simple visuals, essential mechanics.** Visual restraint means basic surfaces,
terrain shading and tree canopies instead of photorealism. It does not reduce the
requirements for flight, contact, collision, cup behaviour or reliable controls.
The procedural renderer is a small experiment. The photographic version is kept
for comparison and loaded only when selected.

**Two physics versions.** The desktop lab preserves the original engine. Paired
play uses the experimental fundamentals model. Versioned shot evidence makes the
distinction explicit. Analytical checks are evidence of mechanical/numerical
consistency; they do not establish agreement with real turf or measured ball flight.

The initial email placed new work after the study gate. The owner subsequently
authorised implementation in this session. No later scope change should silently
turn this proof of concept into a hosted service or treat experimental coefficients
as measured data.

## Documentation ownership

Settled architecture and its reasons belong in the nearest `COSMOLOGY.md`. Keep
code comments for equations, units and non-obvious local behaviour. Update the
cosmology when changing a boundary, dependency, physical assumption or failure
policy. Record shipped changes in the changelog and unfinished work in the handoff.

| Document | Questions it answers |
| --- | --- |
| [src/COSMOLOGY.md](src/COSMOLOGY.md) | Which app runs, what loads, and what owns state? |
| [core/COSMOLOGY.md](src/core/COSMOLOGY.md) | How commands become shots, and where do contracts belong? |
| [simulation/COSMOLOGY.md](src/core/simulation/COSMOLOGY.md) | Which equations, evidence, approximations and missing physics? |
| [rendering/COSMOLOGY.md](src/core/rendering/COSMOLOGY.md) | How is the course drawn without image assets? |
| [server/COSMOLOGY.md](server/COSMOLOGY.md) | How do pairing, relay, duplicate clients and reconnects work? |
| [tests/COSMOLOGY.md](tests/COSMOLOGY.md) | What do passing tests prove, and what remains untested? |
| [docs/physics-roadmap.md](docs/physics-roadmap.md) | What physics work remains essential? |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) | What changed and what was checked? |
| [docs/NEXT-SESSION.md](docs/NEXT-SESSION.md) | What should the next session resolve? |

Documentation stays outside `public/`, so the local static server does not serve
it. The original Markdown spec is historical input; its unchanged-physics rule is
superseded by the owner's instruction and these implementation documents.
