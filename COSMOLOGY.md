# Purity golf: why this project exists

UCG-50 is the local test bed for separating a golf experience into a course-only
display and a phone cockpit, before carrying the pattern into Odysseus/Unreal.
The phone carries decisions; the screen carries the place. The original
`UCG50_R06_Play.html` is retained as evidence and an executable baseline.

The next experience is not obliged to inherit the original entry flow. Purity now
opens with a clubhouse, course selection, guidance and a short account of that
transition. A collapsible controller can also live directly over the course. The
owner explicitly requested this desktop alternative; the full-screen course is
still available by collapsing controls and hiding navigation.

## Decisions and their reasons

**Vanilla TypeScript and Vite.** This follows the owner's pattern: explicit application surfaces, shared core, native DOM and CSS. New
code uses strict TypeScript because messages and physics refactors cross module
boundaries. Existing JavaScript remains allowed so extraction does not require a
simultaneous language rewrite. `checkJs` is off; those files are not fully typed.

**One display owns simulation.** The phone sends intent, not authoritative shot
results. A relay delivers messages without calculating physics. This avoids two
independent engines drifting and keeps the complete shot calculation local to the
display browser. The shared engine is reusable without the lab's DOM controls.

**One controller, two transports.** Phone and desktop mount the same controller.
Desktop commands go directly to the authoritative session; phone commands arrive
through the relay. Both use the same validation, shot gates and snapshots. A second
window, iframe or second simulation is unnecessary. Local controls work even when
the pairing server is unavailable.

**Dark by default.** Indoor play motivated the owner's explicit preference for
dark controls. Forest/charcoal surfaces, warm ivory text and restrained lime actions
replace the washed-out light stack. An ivory option is saved per browser. The
provided sports-interface references informed hierarchy, navigation and distinct
screens; the illustrated landscape informed composition and layered ground colour.
The reference images stay review-only and ignored, never imported by the app.

**Local WebSocket relay.** One Node process serves the built app and joins one
display to one phone. There is no signalling service, cloud session database,
account system, multi-room platform, or server-side physics. GitHub is source
history and synchronisation, not game networking or hosting. Tests also run locally.

**Natural presentation, essential mechanics.** The successful paired trial led
to an expanded presentation brief: rounded phone controls, sans typography,
a full-viewport course and an interactive shot camera. Warm fairways, pale greens,
cooler rough and muted blue-green water establish a readable colour hierarchy.
Procedural detail gives the course character without image downloads or
photorealism. This presentation work does not reduce the
requirements for flight, contact, collision, cup behaviour or reliable controls.
The procedural renderer is a small experiment. Purity has a versioned woodland
course with shared visual and physical hazards. The photographic version remains
in the original lab because it depicts the original layout.

**Quiet, intentional presentation.** Onest is bundled locally with its OFL license,
so typography works without Google Fonts requests. Variable weights distinguish
headlines, actions and supporting information; numeric readouts use tabular figures.
The course starts north-up and supports manual rotation. During uninterrupted play,
one menu button is the only interface overlay. Desktop shot controls fold away on
launch and remain available from that menu; phone controls remain in the player's hand.

**Two physics versions.** The desktop lab preserves the original engine. Paired
play uses the experimental fundamentals model. Versioned shot evidence makes the
distinction explicit. Analytical checks are evidence of mechanical/numerical
consistency; they do not establish agreement with real turf or measured ball flight.

The initial email placed new work after the study gate. The owner subsequently
authorised implementation in this session. No later scope change should silently
turn this proof of concept into a hosted service or treat experimental coefficients
as measured data.

## Documentation ownership

Settled architecture and its reasons belong in the nearest `COSMOLOGY.md`. Keep
code comments for equations, units and non-obvious local behaviour. Update the
cosmology when changing a boundary, dependency, physical assumption or failure
policy. Record shipped changes in the changelog and unfinished work in the handoff.

| Document | Questions it answers |
| --- | --- |
| [src/COSMOLOGY.md](src/COSMOLOGY.md) | Which app runs, what loads, and what owns state? |
| [core/COSMOLOGY.md](src/core/COSMOLOGY.md) | How commands become shots, and where do contracts belong? |
| [simulation/COSMOLOGY.md](src/core/simulation/COSMOLOGY.md) | Which equations, evidence, approximations and missing physics? |
| [rendering/COSMOLOGY.md](src/core/rendering/COSMOLOGY.md) | How is the course drawn without image assets? |
| [server/COSMOLOGY.md](server/COSMOLOGY.md) | How do pairing, relay, duplicate clients and reconnects work? |
| [tests/COSMOLOGY.md](tests/COSMOLOGY.md) | What do passing tests prove, and what remains untested? |
| [docs/physics-roadmap.md](docs/physics-roadmap.md) | What physics work remains essential? |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) | What changed and what was checked? |
| [docs/NEXT-SESSION.md](docs/NEXT-SESSION.md) | What should the next session resolve? |

Documentation stays outside `public/`, so the local static server does not serve
it. The original Markdown spec is historical input; its unchanged-physics rule is
superseded by the owner's instruction and these implementation documents.
